## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to basketball, in particular how offensive, defensive, and off-ball statistics influence a player's impact on the game. Alternatively, I'm interested in analyzing data about student debt and how that affects future choices, such as buying a home. Finally, I am possibly interested in looking at food price data and how that affects consumer choices.
